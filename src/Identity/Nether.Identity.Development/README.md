# Nether.Identity.Development

This project purely exists to make *development* simpler - it is *NOT* intended for production use. 
It is built with [Identity Server](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4) and creates a locally runnable identity service with a fixed set of in-memory users

This project is based on the `MVC and API` solution in the [IdentityServer4.Samples](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4.Samples) repo.
