master branch status

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4fgaaeakffhf32vu/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/stuartleeks/nether/branch/master)


## Prerequisites

### Development Machine Setup

#### Operating System

The goal of Nether is to be available on both Windows and OSX (Mac), hence any up to date version of those operating systems should be ok.

#### Visual Studio Code and/or full version of Visual Studio

All code should compile and work on both Windows and OSX hence we strive to use Visual Studio Code for as much as possible. With that said we also do support the full version of Visual Studio on Windows.

## Optional Prerequisites

### [Unity](http://unity3d.com)

We support and build SDKs for Unity but Nether as service is available from any operating system that would have access to Internet.
