# Configuration

The configuration for Nether.Web is handled by `appsettings.json` and environment variables.

See the following articles for information on configuring different services in Nether

* [Identity services](identity.md)
* [Leaderboard](leaderboard.md)
* [Player Management](player-management.md)
* TODO Analytics


There is also documentation on how to [override configuration settings using environment variables](appsettings-vs-env-vars.md) rather than by modifying `appsettings.json`.
